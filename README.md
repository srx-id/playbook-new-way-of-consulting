# New Way of Consulting Playbook

Practical guide for business consultants to run top-down strategy with bottom-up machine learning, packaged as an interactive dashboard (not just a slide deck). Written for non-engineers.

## How to Use
- Start with `01_new_way_consulting.md` for the storyline and client flow.
- Use `02_data_pipeline_and_feature_engineering.md` to brief clients on data prep and why we avoid Excel-heavy workflows.
- Refer to `03_algorithm_menu.md` to pick the right analytical tool without jargon.
- Follow `04_dashboard_storytelling.md` to structure the executive dashboard and bottom lines per chart.

## What You Can Promise
- Executive narrative first: Situation → Complication → Question → Answer.
- Bottom-up proof: clean data, tested models, and clear drivers.
- Business-ready assets: reproducible datasets plus a Streamlit dashboard with “so what” on every chart.
