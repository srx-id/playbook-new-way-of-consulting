# New Way of Consulting Playbook

Practical guide for business consultants to run top-down strategy with bottom-up machine learning, packaged as an interactive dashboard (not just a slide deck). Written for non-engineers.

## How to Use (Fast Path)
- Start with [01_new_way_consulting.md](01_new_way_consulting.md) for the storyline and the exact data to request.
- Use [02_data_pipeline_and_feature_engineering.md](02_data_pipeline_and_feature_engineering.md) to explain clean vs processed data and simple feature ideas.
- Pick methods with [03_algorithm_menu.md](03_algorithm_menu.md) in plain language.
- Shape the deck/app with [04_dashboard_storytelling.md](04_dashboard_storytelling.md) so every chart has a one-line “so what.”
- Execute the build with [05_tech_stack_and_pipeline.md](05_tech_stack_and_pipeline.md): tools, copy/paste Python scripts, Windows setup, and the Excel→dashboard recipe.
- Use [06_using_genai.md](06_using_genai.md) to meta-prompt and then run the one-shot prompt that generates the full profiling/cleaning/modeling/dashboard stub.

## What You Can Promise
- Executive narrative first: Situation → Complication → Question → Answer.
- Bottom-up proof: clean data, tested models, and clear drivers.
- Business-ready assets: reproducible datasets plus a Streamlit dashboard with “so what” on every chart.

## Example Use Cases
- Operations performance uplift: Outside-in benchmark, monthly panel, driver ranking, pre/post program impact (pilot sites vs control).  
- Transport security: Journey-level anomaly + rules, hotspot maps, risk bands with actions; exec summary first, drill-down later.  
- Procurement partner performance: Cost-to-service view, partner scorecards, on-time and failure drivers, scenario calculator for savings.  

Same pattern every time: top-down storyline, clean processed data, interpretable baseline, optional non-linear lift, and Streamlit delivery with bottom-line takeaways per chart.
