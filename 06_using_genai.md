# Using GenAI Tools (Plain Language)

How consultants can safely leverage AI assistants (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT/Codex) without needing to code.

## Where GenAI Helps
- **Research and framing:** Summarize public articles, reports, and benchmarks to shape the “where do we stand” view.  
- **Template drafting:** Generate first drafts of interview guides, data request emails, or executive storylines.  
- **Data dictionary cleanup:** Turn messy column names into clear business definitions when given a sample.  
- **Chart annotations:** Suggest “so what” lines for charts once you provide the key numbers.  
- **QA checklists:** Create review checklists for data coverage, duplicates, and missing values based on our standard steps.

## Guardrails for Non-Technical Users
- **No confidential data in public tools:** Strip names/IDs or use approved private instances.  
- **Keep source of truth:** Always store final docs in our repo; AI output is a draft to edit.  
- **Be explicit:** Ask for short, bullet answers; specify audience (executive vs analyst).  
- **Verify numbers:** Never copy AI-generated numbers into client work; only use it to format or summarize what you already have.  
- **Cite inputs:** When pasting text for summarization, note the source so we can attribute if needed.

## Example Prompts (Copy/Paste)
- “Summarize these three bullets into an executive-friendly ‘so what’ (keep under 40 words).”  
- “Rewrite this data request email to sound clearer and concise for a business stakeholder; keep the five column names unchanged.”  
- “Given these column names and sample rows, propose business-friendly definitions; highlight any unclear fields to confirm with the client.”  
- “Draft chart captions for an exec dashboard: I’ll paste metric, trend, and target. Keep each caption to one line and plain language.”  
- “Create a checklist to review a new Excel drop: coverage, duplicates, missing values, unit consistency. Keep it to 8 bullets.”

Use GenAI to speed up drafting and polishing; keep analysis, numbers, and decisions grounded in our data and code.
